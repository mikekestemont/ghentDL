    "We are now ready to add a naive `fit` method to optimize the parameters of our perceptron. In each **epoch**, we loop over each parameter individually and test two different situations: *hypothesis a*, in which we slightly increase (with a small rate `learning_rate`) and *hypothesis b*, in which we slightly decrease the weight under scrutiny (again with a small `learning` rate). Then, we adjust the parameters in the light of whichever hypothesis gave the best result (i.e. minimized the loss). That goes like this:"

    "What we implemented above is 'traditional' gradient descent, where we base our gradient updates on loss on the entire dataset at once. In present-day research in representation learning, most data sets are too large too fit in memory, especially if you train networks on GPU which have much more restricted memory capabilities (which sadly compensates their incredible speed). Therefore, scientist nowadays turn to either **stochastic gradient descent** (SGD), where the updates are based on the loss of a smaller sample of the data. Most commonly, people use **minibatch gradient descent**, where each time the loss is calculated for a small random batch of training instances. Common batch sizes range from 30 to 150 (depending on how much data you can fit into memory at once). **Exercise**: implement the SGD training approach with a minibatch size of 25. In each epoch, you should loop over the entire data set in minibatches of 25 training instances from `X` and `y`. Calculate the loss for each batch and update the gradients in the light of the gradients you obtain."
